<p class="ce-title"><a href="ce-blm.html">Black Lives Matter Movement</a></p>
<!-- add img-->
<p>The Black Lives Matter movement was created in 2013 after George Zimmerman, the killer of an innocent 17 year old boy named Trayvon Martin, was unjustifiably acquitted of all charges. Recently, the brutal murder of George Floyd sparked recent protests, and the Black Lives Matter movement has been recieving increasing widespread attention across the world. Throughout history, African Americans have always been systematically oppressed. The Black Lives Matter Movement aims to get justice for victims of police brutality, and end institutionalized racism, once and for all. <p>

<p class="ce-title"><a href="ce-yem.html">Yemen Crisis</a></p>
<!-- add img-->
<p>Yemen is currently facing the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The country is currently in a five-year long civil war and is on the brink of being wiped out from the world map. The people are not only facing war, but also the worst cholera outbreak in modern history. Now they are also struggling with coronavirus, and have very minimal access to medical care, sanitation, and clean water. Furthermore, according to the United Nations, 10 million people are one step away from famine and roughly 24 million people require humanitarian assistance. The only solution to this crisis is by ending the civil war. <p>

<p class="ce-title"><a href="ce-ice.html">ICE Detention Centers</a></p>
<!-- add img -->
<p>In the United States, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention centers are used to  detain immigrants whom may be waiting for determination of their immigration status or potential deportation. These detention centers contain low temperatures, are extremely overcrowded, and people inside have no access to medical care. Under President Trump's administration, 24 people have died within U.S. custody due to the extremely unsanitary conditions. In addition, many young children and women are sexually harrassed by U.S. officers when in ICE custody.  Now with the coronavirus, people get sick very easily in these overcrowded "cages". In response to COVID-19, some detention centers are spraying a harmful disinfectant, up to 50 times a day. According to Insider, the "constant spraying is causing nearly every person to have bloody noses, burning eyes, and headaches." Those that have been detained in these detention centers clearly lack basic human rights.  <p>

<div class="event">
<p class="ce-title"><a href="ce-mmiw.html">Missing & Murdered Indigenous Women</a></p>
<!-- add img -->
<p>Native American women go missing and have a larger chance of being murded in the United States but the problem is rarely talked about in the media. The Department of Justice found that Native American women get murdered at a rate of 10 times the national average. There is little investigation and many are written off because some have drug related issues. "Senator Murkowski said many women disappear from remote reservations -- some that lack even a single police officer. Other times, cases get lost in a confusing web of jurisdictional conflicts between tribal, local and state police. She also worries that some victims are simply discounted because of their race or involvement in prostitution." "The resources are spread so thin, it allows people to fall through the cracks," said Billy J. Stratton, an expert in Native American studies at the University of Denver. <p>

<!-- <div class="event">
<p class="ce-title"><a href="ce-scw.html">Syrian Civil War</a></p> -->
<!-- add img -->
<!-- <p>
According to estimates by the United Nations, more than 400,000 people have been killed in Syria since the start of the war. The UN reports that, as of January 2019, more than 5.6 million have fled the country, and over 6 million have been internally displaced. Many refugees have fled to Jordan and Lebanon, straining already weak infrastructure and limited resources. More than 3.4 million Syrians have fled to Turkey, and many have attempted to seek refuge in Europe.<br>Meanwhile, external military intervention—including the provision of arms and military equipment, training, air strikes, and even troops—in support of proxies in Syria threatens to prolong the conflict. Outside actors—namely Iran, Israel, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the U.S.-led coalition—increasingly operate in proximity to one another, complicating the civil war and raising concerns over an unintended escalation. Ongoing violence and proxy conflicts could also facilitate the resurgence of terrorist groups. [2]<p>

<p class="ce-title"><a href="ce-stl.html">Slave Trade in Libya</a></p> -->
<!-- add img -->
<!-- <p>"Libya is the main locations for refugees and migrants who are attempting to reach Europe by sea. There are about 400,000 to  one million people who are stuck in Libya, and detention centers are overrun and there are mounting reports of robbery, rape, and murder among migrants, according to the U.N. human rights agency. Conditions in the centers have been described as “horrific,” and among other abuses, migrants are vulnerable to being sold off as laborers in slave auctions. Many of these illegal immigrants are mislead into thinking that this will be an place of freedom and escape but in reality, they are auctioned into slavery. This modern day slavery has also created a black market for human body parts as dealers sell organs of those who seek a better life in Europe."[5]<p>

<div class="event">
<p class="ce-title"><a href="ce-mcc.html">Muslim Concentration Camps</a></p>
<!-- add img -->
<p>  Uyghur Muslims and other Muslim groups have been persecuted in China and stripped of their religion through "re-education" programs. In such camps, they are tracked viligantly and tortured. There has been international criticism but no country has taken action. Within these camps, an "ethnic cleansing" is used to wipe out the Uyghur minority groups. As there is not much information on this topic in the mainstream media, please do your part to spread awareness. <p>

<!-- lgbtq+ -->
<div class="event">
<p class="ce-title"><a href="ce-lgbtq.html">LGBTQ+</a></p>
<!-- add img -->
<p>The month of June is known for being Pride month. Pride is celebrated to commemorate the Stonewall Riots which occurred during June of 1969. The month of June for many people of the LGBTQ+ community is a time to celebrate freedom and being yourself. Yes, there have been some changes since the Stonewall Riots but in some places LGBTQ+ rights are still being fought for. Currently, Poland is ranked one of the worst countries in Europe for LGBTQ+ rights. Rights for LGBTQ+ citizens in Poland have been limited. In America, the Trump administration is currently trying to place a rule where doctors are allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ+ patients. Last year the house had passed the Equality Act. This allows people of the LGBTQ+ community to be protected from discrimination in places of work, school, and home. Currently there is no information on when the Equality Act will go before the senate for a vote. <p>

<p class="ce-title"><a href="ce-rona.html">Coronavirus</a></p>
<!-- add img -->
<p>Late in the year of 2019 a new unknown virus known as COVID-19 rapidly spread globally. Quickly this virus had shut down schools, businesses, and cancelled many events. Many had lost their jobs which led to a global recession. Many of those people who have lost their jobs applied for unemployment. Some people still have not received unemployment checks. Many healthcare workers are stressed and overworked. These healthcare workers do not have enough PPE to protect themselves from the patients. Cases have gone down since the beginning of the pandemic and things have slowly started to open up.

<div class="event">
<p class="ce-title"><a href="ce-cc.html">Climate Change</a></p>
<!-- add img -->
<p>Climate change is a pervasive issue in our world today. As more greenhouse gas is emitted to the atmosphere, the ozone layer continues to shrink. This allows harmful UV rays to enter the atmosphere of the earth causing change to weather systems which is harmful to our ecosystems and environments across the globe. Our oceans and air temperatures have grown increasingly warm, and sea levels are significantly rising. As the human population continues to grow, modern climate change proves to be very different from natural climate changes in the past. It is essential to replace the use of fossil fuels with sustainable resources that can safely power our modern way of life. <p>
