		<p class="info"> heyy! <br> i'm van, and i'm a rising senior from Hayward, CA. i am involved in Interact, Key Club, cheer, and more! almost all of my free time is spent w/ friends, usually getting boba and kbbq. my inspiration for this page came from Alexis William's website (pb-resources.com) compiling resources for the BLM movement along with the realization that while we are fighting for the end of systemic racism, there are other injustices that are fighting for their end as well. in no way do i mean this as undermining the blm movement, but as acknowledging that the fight for equity is ongoing. as an Asian American, the privilege i have is different from others in this world, and although i will never understand the struggles others face, i will continue to educate myself and be any ally. through this website, i hope that i can make a difference in my community<3 <br><br> feel free to contact me through my ig: @vannytrinh :)</p>

		<p class="info"> hey there! my name is maddy ren and i'm from san diego, california! i am 15 years old, and I am going to be a sophomore in high school next school year. in my free time, I love to swim, go to the beach, and get boba! :)) with all the recent events going on in the world, i wanted to make a change, but i wasn't too sure how i'd make a difference. once i joined kode with klossy, i decided that i wanted to make a difference using my newfound coding superpowers. and so, the four of us came together, and we coded this website! there are so many current events in our world today, that we wanted to compile them all, so that you can have easy access to many different current day events. if you are interested in a topic, and can't find it on our website, feel free to reach out to us! we want to be as inclusive as possible; all of your stories are welcome here! :) i really hope you found our website informative and that it may have impacted you in a positive way. thank you for visiting OurStories! have a wonderful day <3 </p>

		<p class="info"> Hi! My name is Savannah Alkhoury! I am 17 and currently a senior in high school! I am from Martinez, California which is in the Bay Area! I love playing golf, exploring, and going on adventures! I hope our website helps inform you on some current events that are going on! So much is going on in the world and not many are informed about what is going on or have easy access to resources to help. When I joined Kode with Klossy I knew that I could use my new skill of coding to create something to help inform many on these current issues! I'm so glad I met Maddy, Van, and Kelly and we got to work together and collaborate on this amazing website! If there is anything you would like to see on our website please let us know! All stories are welcome! We want our website to be an inclusive safe space for all to share!  </p>

		<p class="info"> welcome to our webpage! i'm kelly, a rising freshman in college. i'm from cupertino, california which is near san francisco and the bay area. i love journaling and reading in my free time. i'm also addicted to philz coffee even though i have a low caffiene tolerance and i'm an avid fan of lowercase letters. <br> on a more serious note, i recognize that society is plauged with an overwhelming amount of humanitarian issues that need to be addressed. often it can be overwhelming to research and take meaningful steps toward ensuring social equity. i hope that this website will give you the resources necessary to educate yourself about ongoing issues and allow you to create a positive impact in society. additionally, the importance of our individual experiences is highlighted in this page. i encourage you to submit your story as it will provide unique insight into the complex and interwoven fabric of the human experience.</p>
